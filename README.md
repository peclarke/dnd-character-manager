# DND Character Tracker
This project is a game tool to help keep track of characters you meet in your DND campaigns.
Add characters you meet, write notes about them, customise them for memorabilia and enjoy.

We've got cool things like:
- Filter characters by session met
- Authentication (for keeping your DND secrets to yourself)
- A navigation bar! (I know)
- Addition, removal, and pinning of infinitely many characters you meet across many sessions.

Goals:
- multiple campaign selection
- customisable interface
- search for characters
- encapsulate a bunch of things under a setting hamburger thing
